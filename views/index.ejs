        <h1>Features Coming Soon</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Major Updates</h2>
        <p>These features is where I would really like to see the site evolve to but also will be the hardest to integrate and will take the most time..</p>
        <div class="command-list">
            <div class="command">
                <h3>Halo 5 API Integration</h3>
                <p>Will provide post game carnage report or all matches played in scrim. This is also the largest update and most work. So may not be the first to get rolled out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>Detailed Statistics</h3>
                <p>Once the Halo 5 API is integrated there will be a wealth of information readily available. So why not make use of it to provide analysis of teams and players which can point out strenghts and weaknesses in general and against specific teams and/or players.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>Login with Twitch/Microsoft and Dashboard</h3>
                <p>Also a big feature. Logging with twitch and/or Microsoft account will allow identity authentication. Then a web interface for managing teams and players can be used.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Minor Updates</h2>
        <p>These are the features which can more immediately be accomplished and make the overall experience much better.</p>
        <div class="command-list">
            <div class="command">
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>As it stands this site is purely up for the functionality. Design and aesthetics can always be improved later incrementally and as more data to each page gets added design will accomodate. At it's core does this bot/site do what we want it as a Halo commuity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>Team Stats Page</h3>
                <p>Similar to the user page. There will be a page with team stats.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>!win !loss Limiting</h3>
                <p>As it stands !win and !loss can be spammed. I will limit it so one scrim regardless of the channel the commands are run from cannot be excessive. Two twitch channels watching the same scrim using the same bot. Would report more wins or losses than occuring. Will limit to one use of score updating to every 5 mins.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>!editscore</i></h3>
                <p>If an incorrect !win or !loss is entered this will provide a way to resolve the score.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>Add date to scrim</i></h3>
                <p>Date of scrim will be added based on when the <strong>!newseries</strong> command is run.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="command">
                <h3>!setgt</h3>
                <p>This will set the users gamertag. Which will be used to as the players display name instead of their twitch username.</p>
